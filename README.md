# Airport Baggage Handling System (ANDB)

## Overview
This project focuses on **creating and managing system requirements using Jira** for an **Airport Baggage Handling System** as part of the **ANDB (Advanced Database Systems)** subject.

The work is organized into **time-boxed sprints**, where Jira tasks are used to design, validate, and implement a database-driven baggage management solution using **SQL Server** and **Power BI**.

---


## Objectives
- Understand airport baggage handling workflows
- Model functional and non-functional requirements using Jira
- Practice requirement engineering for large-scale systems
- Prepare a foundation for database and system design (ANDB context)

---

## System Scope: Baggage Handling at an Airport
The baggage handling system covers the lifecycle of baggage from **check-in to aircraft loading and arrival reclaim**.

### Key Processes
- Passenger baggage check-in
- Baggage tagging and tracking
- Conveyor belt routing
- Security screening
- Aircraft loading and unloading
- Lost, delayed, or damaged baggage handling

---

## Jira Usage
This project uses Jira to plan and track sprint-based development activities.

### Sprint Information
**Sprint Name:** Airport Sprint 4

**Sprint Duration:** 4 December – 18 December

**Sprint Goal:**
Deliver the first functional foundation of the baggage management system by enabling the team to register, validate, store, and retrieve baggage data, and to provide initial visibility of baggage information through basic dashboards.

### Sprint Tasks
- Design baggage database schema
- Database registration of checked-in baggage
- Baggage weight validation
- Baggage loading list generation
- Develop baggage location dashboard UI
- Passenger receipt and confirmation generation
- Build flight statistics reporting module

### Jira Issue Types
- **Task**: Database, validation, reporting, and dashboard work items
- **Story**: Functional baggage handling requirements

## Database Perspective (ANDB)

From an ANDB standpoint, Jira issues are designed to later map into:
- Relational tables (Baggage, Passenger, Flight, Conveyor, Screening)
- Transactions for baggage movement
- Constraints for security and tracking accuracy

## Tools and Technologies

- Jira – Used for sprint planning, task tracking, and requirement management
- Microsoft SQL Server – Used for designing and implementing the baggage handling database
- Power BI – Used for creating dashboards and reports for baggage location and flight statistics

---



## Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience using Jira for system analysis
- Better understanding of airport operational systems
- Ability to convert real-world processes into structured requirements
- Strong foundation for database design in ANDB
